            >Varese Group convened for the first time in 2017 when Fiona Connor
            invited a small group of artists, writers, architects, curators, and
            designers to meet in northern Italy, with a gentle commitment to
            keep coming back in the following years. For three consecutive
            summers we spent a full, unhurried week together, with each
            participant gently taking responsibility for an event or
            presentation: giving a talk or slide show, presenting artwork,
            leading a field trip. Common interests included a fascination with
            place, site, and temporality; a commitment to institutional
            critique; and a desire to delve into the histories of architecture
            and exhibition design. The materiality of a specific location was
            central to these concerns. We made food together, went on long
            walks, and discovered overlapping interests and intersecting
            histories. We made new friends and indulged old ones; certain
            individuals fell in love; coincidences unfolded. One year a baby
            attended, and we all discovered the meaning of tummy time. The
            participants came from Los Angeles, Auckland, Berlin, New York,
            Lisbon, Glasgow, various cities in Italy, and elsewhere. In time, a
            series of programs took place in Los Angeles, and during the
            pandemic, a fourth iteration of Varese Group came together remotely,
            with old and new participants spanning multiple countries and time
            zones.</span

            engages the work of Roger Caillois (1913-1978), in particular his
            extraordinary essay on mimicry, first published in the Surrealist
            journal </span
          ><em><span>Minotaure</span></em
          ><span>
            in 1935, where Caillois argues that insects and other animals who
            practice camouflage are not primarily motivated by a wish to
            survive. Whether through imitating less vulnerable creatures (such
            as butterflies with wings patterned in shapes that resemble large
            eyes) or disappearing into their environment to the point of
            invisibility, Caillois sees such mimicry as a luxury, even </span
          ><em><span>a dangerous luxury</span></em
          ><span
            >, invoking the compulsive pleasures that accompany the dissolving
            of distinctions between self and other. Ignoring Darwin’s theory of
            evolution, this poetic proposition implicitly links mimicry to
            Freud’s idea of the death drive. In his later writing on play and
            games, Caillois outlined four fundamental structures of play that
            may prove useful in thinking about other human practices, such as
            art. In particular, his description of the delights of
            disorientation, such as children spinning in circles or the
            experience of thrill rides at the fair, recalls our contemporary
            experience within the digital realm, where the erasure of distinct
            boundaries and locations imparts an echo of our eventual demise. 16

            considers the electronic music of Pauline Oliveros circa 1966-67,
            coinciding with her time as the inaugural director of the Tape Music
            Center at Mills College in Oakland, California. An inventor of
            pioneering tape delay techniques, Oliveros began to explore the
            possibilities of the Buchla synthesizer in the electronic music
            studio at Mills, with the window open to the “bog”–really, a pond–
            below. Soon after, she presented a 12-hour “Tape-athon” before
            leaving Mills and the Bay Area for a teaching position at UC San
            Diego. In this new context, she would develop her influential “Sonic
            Meditations” and the mandala-based scores that are the foundation of
            her eventual Deep Listening philosophy. This pamphlet focuses
            attention on an important moment of transition for Oliveros, both
            personally and musically. Drawings by Ruoyi Shi. 32 pages.

            >Bob Bemer invented Y2K. In his work as a computer scientist he also
            proposed the escape (ESC) character be included in the new ASCII
            standard when it was developed in 1960 to help standardize
            electronic communications. In modern keyboard-use the ESC key is
            generally mapped to some form of interrupt: no, quit, cancel, stop,
            or abort. In 1960 computer interfaces were still keyboard-only and
            Bemer formalized the idea that an escape key could signal a switch
            of modes, from language to instruction – that subsequent characters
            entered were to be interpreted and not displayed. It allowed for an
            expansion of the alphabet present on the keyboard, giving space for
            individual letters to also embody actions. *ESC** reproduces a
            selection of asterisk forms cut from medium-density fibreboard (MDF)
            and printed (on paper) by participants at an April 11, 2021 Varese
            Group workshop in Oratia, Aotearoa New Zealand. These works
            illustrate a short text by Olds exploring the magic of the asterisk
            and some of its contemporary applications. 16 pages.</span
