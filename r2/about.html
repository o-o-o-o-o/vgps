            Varese Group convened for the first time in 2017 when Fiona
              Connor invited a small group of artists, writers, architects,
              curators, and designers to meet in northern Italy, with a gentle
              commitment to keep coming back in the following years. For three
              consecutive summers we spent a full, unhurried week together, with
              each participant gently taking responsibility for an event or
              presentation: giving a talk or slide show, presenting artwork,
              leading a field trip. Common interests included a fascination with
              place, site, and temporality; a commitment to institutional
              critique; and a desire to delve into the histories of architecture
              and exhibition design. The materiality of a specific location was
              central to these concerns. We made food together, went on long
              walks, and discovered overlapping interests and intersecting
              histories. We made new friends and indulged old ones; certain
              individuals fell in love; coincidences unfolded. One year a baby
              attended, and we all discovered the meaning of tummy time. The
              participants came from Los Angeles, Auckland, Berlin, New York,
              Lisbon, Glasgow, various cities in Italy, and elsewhere. In time,
              a series of programs took place in Los Angeles, and during the
              pandemic, a fourth iteration of Varese Group came together
              remotely, with old and new participants spanning multiple
              countries and time zones.

            The Varese Group Pamphlet Series was initiated as a way for the
              group to share threads of research and output with a broader
              public. Pamphlets are published in series, with the first set of
              three by Leslie Dick, Michael Ned Holte, and Warren Olds, 
              followed by a second set by Marta Fontolan, Sasha Portis, and Lucy
              Skaer.
          <br><br>
            The pamphlets are Risograph-printed in black on 70 lb. White
              Cougar paper, and staple-bound in quarto signatures.
