            1. Leslie Dick: Voluptuous Panic / Digital Whirlpool / Digital Panic / Voluptuous Whirlpool
            <br><br>
            <em>Voluptuous Panic/Digital Whirlpool</em>
              engages the work of Roger Caillois (1913-1978), in particular his
              extraordinary essay on mimicry, first published in the Surrealist
              journal Minotaure
              in 1935, where Caillois argues that insects and other animals who
              practice camouflage are not primarily motivated by a wish to
              survive. Whether through imitating less vulnerable creatures (such
              as butterflies with wings patterned in shapes that resemble large
              eyes) or disappearing into their environment to the point of
              invisibility, Caillois sees such mimicry as a luxury, even <em>a dangerous luxury</em
            >, invoking the compulsive pleasures that accompany the dissolving
              of distinctions between self and other. Ignoring Darwin’s theory
              of evolution, this poetic proposition implicitly links mimicry to
              Freud’s idea of the death drive. In his later writing on play and
              games, Caillois outlined four fundamental structures of play that
              may prove useful in thinking about other human practices, such as
              art. In particular, his description of the delights of
              disorientation, such as children spinning in circles or the
              experience of thrill rides at the fair, recalls our contemporary
              experience within the digital realm, where the erasure of distinct
              boundaries and locations imparts an echo of our eventual demise.
              16 pages.

          2. Michael Ned Holte: Bog Time
          <br><br>
            <em>Bog Time</em>
              considers the electronic music of Pauline Oliveros circa 1966-67,
              coinciding with her time as the inaugural director of the Tape
              Music Center at Mills College in Oakland, California. An inventor
              of pioneering tape delay techniques, Oliveros began to explore the
              possibilities of the Buchla synthesizer in the electronic music
              studio at Mills, with the window open to the “bog”–really, a pond–
              below. Soon after, she presented a 12-hour “Tape-athon” before
              leaving Mills and the Bay Area for a teaching position at UC San
              Diego. In this new context, she would develop her influential
              “Sonic Meditations” and the mandala-based scores that are the
              foundation of her eventual Deep Listening philosophy. This
              pamphlet focuses attention on an important moment of transition
              for Oliveros, both personally and musically. Drawings by Ruoyi
              Shi. 32 pages.

            3. Warren Olds: ESC*
            <br><br>
            Bob Bemer invented Y2K. In his work as a computer scientist he
              also proposed the escape (ESC) character be included in the new
              ASCII standard when it was developed in 1960 to help standardize
              electronic communications. In modern keyboard-use the ESC key is
              generally mapped to some form of interrupt: no, quit, cancel,
              stop, or abort. In 1960 computer interfaces were still
              keyboard-only and Bemer formalized the idea that an escape key
              could signal a switch of modes, from language to instruction –
              that subsequent characters entered were to be interpreted and not
              displayed. It allowed for an expansion of the alphabet present on
              the keyboard, giving space for individual letters to also embody
              actions. *ESC** reproduces a selection of asterisk forms cut from
              medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and printed (on paper) by
              participants at an April 11, 2021 Varese Group workshop in Oratia,
              Aotearoa New Zealand. These works illustrate a short text by Olds
              exploring the magic of the asterisk and some of its contemporary
              applications. 16 pages.
